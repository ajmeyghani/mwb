# Todos

- Add notes on adding dependencies to the app: why npm and bower ? when to use require, etc etc.
- Use pm2 to serve the app in prod.
- Add docker file.
- Add deploy task (bin/deploy)
- Add details on folder structure.
- add task for cleaning up the docs and extra files when the boilerplate is downloaded.
- Should the docs be in it's own repo ? Probably not ... so how can we communicate the docs with the user ?
