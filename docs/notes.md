# IMPORTANT NOTES

### Setting Module Name

Look for the string `mymodulename` and change it in:

1. `config/client.config.js`
2. `client/src/main.js`
3. `client/index.html`

Before you start, note:

- All the client source code should go into *`client/src`*. This includes all the assets like css, js, png, svg, template files, etc etc.

- If you want to access arbitrary static files, put them in `client/static`. This folder is exposed via the `/static` server path if you decide to take advantage of the provided express server.

- Also, leave the `client/static/bundle` alone. The content of that folder is generated by webpack when you `require` anything in your app.

- Webpack is already looking at the `client/src` folder for "assets". So you can simply require assets without specifying `client/src` everytime. That is, if a file is at `client/src/component/component.js`, you can require it with: `require('component/component.js')`. If you want to set more "modules folder", add them to the `config/client.config.js` file, in the `resolve` section.

- Use webpack externals if you don't want to include a module in your final bundle (but load it via a script tag) See `client/src/main.js` for an example on how angular is required.
